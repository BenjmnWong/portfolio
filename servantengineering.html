                This two semester course is a mix of software and hardware learning. We are currently aiding a non-profit rowing company in Salem create an
                afforable alternative to indoor rowing monitors to replace the broken ones at their facility. We are doing this by installing and modifying
                an open source rowing machine software on GitHub.
